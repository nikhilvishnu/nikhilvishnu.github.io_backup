I have always loved and enjoyed reading. Until recently I considered myself a casual reader. However as I look back on my journey of reading; I realize 2016 has been a huge turnaround and has turned me into a rather voracious reader.

I got opportunities to closely interact with an amazing set of people who introduced me to different genre of books. Some inspired me with their thoughtful, wise and interesting thoughts of books that they have read. Some went a step ahead and gifted me some wonderful books. So here I am as dusk falls on 2016; to ring a wonderful 2017; with 30+ books in my reading repertoire.
