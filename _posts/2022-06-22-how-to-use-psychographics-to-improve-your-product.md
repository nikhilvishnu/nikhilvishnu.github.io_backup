Misunderstanding target user is the number one reason for product failure. To avoid this you should understand your audience really well.

Psychographics helps you understand your users based on their aspirations, interests and attitudes.

## **What is psychographics?**

Psychographics is a methodology of studying users based on their attitudes, interests, aspirations, values and opinions.

Demographic segmentation helps you explain customer information like age, gender, income and location. But this will not give you any insights into what motivates your users to use your product. To understand the cognitive factors involved in your customer decisions you need psychographics. Demographics help us understand **who** uses our product and psychographics tells us **why**.

Psychographics also can be used to represent what we call “**culture**” around a product or service.
